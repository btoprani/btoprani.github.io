Research conducted before my first day and business needs connected in the need for a Home Page for the product, a fleshed out new user experience, and finding a way to bring users of the legacy software into the Intersight framework.";

The next best thing was interviewing stakeholders comprising of Sales Engineers, Customer Support Representatives, and Customer-facing Product Managers. I learned a lot about our users like many of them worked in shifts and didn't have a good way of knowing what had already been done and what had changed in the system since their last shift. The two things consistent with every single person I interviewed were that ";

export const earlyStageWireframesText = "This gave me the groundwork to start designing Wireframes. Given the multiple built out design systems in place, it made sense to use them and turn what would otherwise be Low Fidelity into something more akin to Mid Fidelity Wireframes. \n\nAt the beginning, I started with possible Home Pages and Home Page interactions. I designed the Favorite and Recent section first, where I initially thought of having a persistant button at the bottom right corner of the page that would open or close the side panel. Users would be able to favorite pages or actions, as well as unfavorite them quickly and easily. My initial thoughts on the recents tab of the panel were to do something similar, where users would click on a card to navigate to the page or action. \n\nSince many of our users work in shifts, I added a section letting them know what had changed since they last logged in. I also integrated AI through buttons within the widgets in this section that would allow users to solve problems and complete tasks by opening the agent. \n\nFinally, I created a section to educate users on features of their payment tier and licenses that they weren't using but could help them, as well as features from any payment tiers above theirs that they might not know about.";
export const userTestingText = "I conducted user testing the wireframes with a subset of the stakeholders that I used for research, as well as a few designers that worked on the product, and then collated the feedback. The predominant feedback was that as it stood, the page didn't reduce user time or effort to do the same things. It was adding another step in the process, rather than simplifying the process. Also the favorites button did not fit the Cisco design system, and a button on the home bar would be a better option, along with turning the side panel into a drawer. Another common piece of feedback was that a lot of the page looked too cramped.";
export const midStageWireframesText = "This helped me course correct and gave me the clarity I needed to design out the rest of the project. I removed the favorite and recent button and sidebar and made it a drawer with an icon in the top menu bar. I updated the spacing on the page to be more readable. I added functionality to the Recents tab to allow the user more control over how they interacted with their recent page or action. \n\nHaving addressed the issues that came up in the User Testing, it was time to design the AI and New User experiences. I designed an AI flow to show how it would work and increase efficiency for the user. I also designed the skeleton of a New User flow within the Home Page. While I was designing it, the scope changed and I was told to design only the skeleton because the Product team wanted it to integrate the New User experience with a new technology that Cisco is still building out, and time would not allow for me to design the full flow.";
export const usabilityTestingText = "After finishing this iteration of the design it was time for Usability Testing. I unfortunately had to conduct this round of testing with the same stakeholders as the previous round. The new Favorite and Recent tabs were universally well received. There was no feedback on the New User flow other than liking the integration with the Home Page. 80% of users asked for better customizability. Furthermore, 100% of Product Managers asked to reorder Home Page widgets in a way that would better emphasize changes since last user login/shift. 66% of users mentioned wanting to see more AI-based insights and recommendations for each of the cards in the section for things that changed since the user's last login/shift.";

I also designed a couple screens for how the customization of the Home Page could work. I finished off this iteration with AI based tooltips when relevant for Home Page widgets.";
export const conclusionText = "The goal of this project was to be an evolving proof of concept that solved the needs of customers reluctant to move to the new platform, as well as invest in AI in an efficient and non-intrusive way. I believe I succeeded in that venture. \n\nIf I had to do the entire project again, I would have cut down on the initial research and started designing a week earlier. It would have been more efficient to receive a stronger course correction sooner and would have led to a more fleshed out proof of concept, especially in the New User Flow.";
