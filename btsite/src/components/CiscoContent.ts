export const earlyStageWireframesText = "When starting Early Stage Wireframes, I had the unique challenge of having multiple built-out design systems in place. Using them, however, allowed me to skip Low Fidelity entirely and start designing Mid Fidelity Wireframes right away without wasting any time.\n\nI tackled the Home Page flow first, given that it would solve more user issues. To make sure the legacy systems made it into the Home Page, I designed the Favorite and Recent section first. This first iteration consisted of a persistent button at the bottom right corner of the page that would open or close the side panel with a tab each for Favorites and Recents. Users would be able to favorite pages or actions, as well as unfavorite them quickly and easily. I decided to do something similar with the Recents tab of the panel, having users click on a card to navigate to the associated page or action.\n\nNext, I focused on users working in shifts by adding a section to the Home Page highlighting changes since their last log-in. In order to integrate AI in a way that would help users with as little friction as possible, I also added AI  buttons within the widgets in this section that would allow users to solve problems and complete tasks by opening the agent. \n\nFinally, I addressed business needs by creating a section to educate users on features of their payment tier and licenses that they weren't using but could help them, as well as features from any payment tiers above theirs that they might not know about. That was sufficient to move to the user testing phase.";

Feedback predominantly centered around how many the Home Page features needed to further reduce user time and effort.

Another common piece of feedback regarding the visuals was that users preferred wider spacing.";
export const midStageWireframesText = "Based on that feedback, I started by removing the favorite and recent button and sidebar and made it a drawer with an icon in the top menu bar. Next, I updated the spacing on the page to be more readable. I then added functionality to the Recents tab to allow the user more control over how they interacted with their recent page or action. \n\nHaving addressed the issues that came up in the User Testing, it was time to design the AI and New User experiences. I designed an AI flow to show how it would work and increase efficiency for the user. I also designed the skeleton of a New User flow within the Home Page. While I was designing it, the scope of the project changed due to a delay in building out new technology out of my control, which limited the fidelity of the New User flow to a simpler one.";

I would also continue designing Home Page widgets based on customer feedback and asks.";
